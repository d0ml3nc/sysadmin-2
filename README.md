System-admin scripts


monitor.sh
----------

nagios nrpe alternative, use with cron and send_nsca to have a minimalistic
nrpe alternative. Can be used for 'unreachable' hosts.

Host-specific configuration (paths / checks to run) goes in monitor.rc file

If you are running a MQTT server, you can have monitor.sh also report status updates and warnings to a MQTT topic. This required mosquitto_pub to be present on the system.

check_ssllabs.sh
----------------

Check Qualys ssllabs.com site for score/configuration of a https certificate
Trigger nagios warning/error when score drops below 85.
Don't run more then 1x per hour. Run the reset_ssllabs.sh script no more then 1x per day.
It can take up to 5 minutes between a reset and a cache-update.

check_ssd_attribs.pl
--------------------

Nagios/Icinga check-script to monitor various SMART attributes on (SSD) drives. Will calculate
the percentage of TBW (total bytes written), and monitor various other attributes used by
(for example) Samsung 840 Pro ssd's.
